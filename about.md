  Hey there! Welcome to my BLOG! If you are wondering w.t.f. those <strong>Webdings</strong> are, read on!
</p>

So, here is what they are. In Dutch, a thing is a **ding**. And I live in Amsterdam. I thought it would be fun to call my personal notes on all the things web as **Webdings**.

I have taken the idea of this blog website from **[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)** blog generator ornated with a **[Lanyon theme](http://lanyon.getpoole.com)**:

<h3>
  <strong>Setup</strong>
</h3>

Some fun facts about the setup of this project include:

*   Built for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)
*   Developed on GitHub and hosted for free on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com)
*   Coded with [Atom](https://atom.io/), a code editor that sometimes rocks

Happy reading and happy coding!
