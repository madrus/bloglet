# Creating my blog with Jekyll on GitHub Pages

> Blog link: [https://madrus.github.io/bloglet][1]

For my theme, I have taken the [Lanyon Theme][2]. And here is its [source code link][3]. I have also found a very nice tutorial how to begin with it:  [GitHub Pages and Jekyll Beginner Video][4]. I have also decided to keep the original three posts of **Mark Otto** [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo) in my blog as an honor to his work and as an introduction to his theme.

## Initial Project Setup

*   run the blog locally: `bundle exec jekyll serve`
*   create a new `gh-pages` branch: `git branch gh-pages`
*   push `master` and `gh-pages` branches to `GitHub`
*   the blog will be available at [https://madrus.github.io/bloglet][1]
*   If we want to our blog to be available at our own domain, we can add `CNAME` file in the root with just the `URL`, e.g.:

    ```
    myblogurl.com
    ```

    As soon as we commit the file to the `gh-pages` repository and push it to `GitHub`, we can navigate to [myblogurl.com](http://myblogurl.com) to see our blog.

    *   `git add .`
    *   `git commit -am "cname added"`
    *   `git push -u origin master`
    *   `git checkout gh-pages`
    *   `git merge master`
    *   `git push -u origin gh-pages`

## Creating Markdown posts

    This is work in progress.

### Sorting

* sort by blog post date descending:

  ```c
  {% assign posts_list = site.posts | sort: "url" | reverse %}
  ```

* sort categories alphabetically:

  ```c
  {% assign cats = site.categories | sort %}
  ```

## Links to contributors

We can `@mention` a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<code><a></code>` element will link to the contributor's `GitHub Profile`. For example:

```html
<p>In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>),
PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>),
and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>)
founded GitHub.</p>
```
## Deployment to GitHub Pages

[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) are freely hosted by `GitHub` on its `github.io`. My personal page is [madrus.github.io](https://madrus.github.io).

Deployment itself -if all the installation and configuration steps are successfully completed- is actually very simple. Just push the new version to `master` branch and refresh your blog page.

## Enabling Travis and GitHub

Enabling Travis builds for your GitHub repository is pretty simple:

1. Go to your profile on travis-ci.org: https://travis-ci.org/profile/username
2. Find the repository for which you’re interested in enabling builds.
3. Click the slider on the right so it says “ON” and is a dark grey.
4. Optionally configure the build by clicking on the gear icon. Further configuration happens in your `.travis.yml` file.
